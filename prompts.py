**EXAMPLES:**

Example 1:
Ticket: "Hi team, we're trying to set up our primary Snowflake production database as a new source in Atlan, but the connection keeps failing. Our entire BI team is blocked on this integration for a major upcoming project, so it's quite urgent."
Classification: {{"topic": "Connector", "sentiment": "Frustrated", "priority": "P1"}}

Example 2:
Ticket: "I'm new to Atlan and trying to understand the lineage capabilities. The documentation mentions automatic lineage, but it's not clear which of our connectors support this out-of-the-box."
Classification: {{"topic": "Product", "sentiment": "Curious", "priority": "P2"}}

Example 3:
Ticket: "This is infuriating. We have a critical Snowflake view that is built from three upstream tables. Atlan is correctly showing downstream dependencies, but the upstream lineage is completely missing. This makes the view untrustworthy for our analysts."
Classification: {{"topic": "Lineage", "sentiment": "Angry", "priority": "P1"}}
